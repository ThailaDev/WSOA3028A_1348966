<h2>Why skateboarding is currently not inclusive</h2>    
</header> 

<article>
<p>Skateboarding was and to some extent still is male dominated. The skateboarding community currently only comprises of around 9 - 25% women depending on the source. </p>
<p>Skateboarding is an extreme sport, and many people still think that women are too fragile to participate in it. When it comes to skateboarding men and women’s biological differences do not matter, both have the right equipment to get on a board. It is just due to the socially constructed notion that women cannot take a beating that many still believe they do not have a place in skateboarding. </p>
<p>In the 70’s and 80’s there was a big fall in the number of skaters in general due to many of the parks closing and street skating being banned in most places. In the 90’s there was a resurgence but skateboarding was mostly marketed to men under the age of 18 which is very off putting to many women because going to a park and knowing you’re most likely to be the only woman there made the scene feel hostile. </p>
<p>‘Women’s sports’ such as netball or tennis reinforces the notions of how women ‘should’ behave due to the rigid bodily control that it forced upon its players. When women were involved in sports that allowed them to be freer with their bodies, they were heavily criticized for being un-ladylike. </p>
<p>Since sports are mainly controlled by men even today, there is a big stereotype of the ‘masculinisation’ of women who play more ‘dangerous’ sports which could lead them to lesbianism. – This stereotype is not only sexist but also homophobic.</p>
<p>How can we, as women make skateboarding more inclusive for women and the LGBTQIA+ communities? Well as a start, forming area specific girl skate group initiatives allows girls to start skateboarding in a safe environment. One such group is the Girls Skate Johannesburg group which provides girls with boards and have frequent meetups. The Girls Skate Group also allows anyone from the LGBTQIA+ community to join as well. </p>
