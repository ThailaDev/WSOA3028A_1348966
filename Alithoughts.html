            <h2>Why skateboarding is currently not inclusive</h2>
        </header>
        <article>
            <p>Skateboarding was and to some extent still is male dominated. The skateboarding community currently only comprises of around 9 - 25% women depending on the source. </p>
            <p>Skateboarding is an extreme sport, and many people still think that women are too fragile to participate in it. When it comes to skateboarding men and women’s biological differences do not matter, both have the right equipment to get on a board. It is just due to the socially constructed notion that women cannot take a beating that many still believe they do not have a place in skateboarding. </p>
            <p>In the 70’s and 80’s there was a big fall in the number of skaters in general due to many of the parks closing and street skating being banned in most places. In the 90’s there was a resurgence but skateboarding was mostly marketed to men under the age of 18 which is very off putting to many women because going to a park and knowing you’re most likely to be the only woman there made the scene feel hostile. </p>
            <p>‘Women’s sports’ such as netball or tennis reinforces the notions of how women ‘should’ behave due to the rigid bodily control that it forced upon its players. When women were involved in sports that allowed them to be freer with their bodies, they were heavily criticized for being un-ladylike. </p>
            <p>Since sports are mainly controlled by men even today, there is a big stereotype of the ‘masculinisation’ of women who play more ‘dangerous’ sports which could lead them to lesbianism. – This stereotype is not only sexist but also homophobic.</p>
            <p>How can we, as women make skateboarding more inclusive for women and the LGBTQIA+ communities? Well as a start, forming area specific girl skate group initiatives allows girls to start skateboarding in a safe environment. One such group is the Girls Skate Johannesburg group which provides girls with boards and have frequent meetups. The Girls Skate Group also allows anyone from the LGBTQIA+ community to join as well. </p>

            <h2>Corona and the Virtual Pride</h2>
        </header>
        <article>
            <p>Hey my dudes and dudettes and everyone in between or outside of! We are currently in the middle of a lockdown in South Africa, due to Covid19 and I am craving to go skating.</p>
            <p>Anyways I just wanted to make a shoutout to the gay TikTok community for keeping me sane during this time. I have made so many wonderful open-minded friends on there during this difficult time and they have helped to make me feel less lonely.</p>
            <p>As you all probably know by now most Pride events have been cancelled this year but some awesome individuals from TikTok, namely @fx.kiara.fx decided to host a virtual Pride during Pride Month. </p>
            <p>Although we cannot celebrate face to face we can celebrate through the power of the internet via streams and podcasts and online challenged and I am so thankful for that! </p>

        <article>
            <p>Hey my lovelies today is a bit dark and I wish I could find some light.</p>
            <p>I have been in lockdown for almost two months now and I have started to see the old black dog. I miss normalcy and being able to skateboard. I have gotten so unfit during this time.</p>
            <p>I have been lacking motivation to do anything and on top of all of that I have not been getting paid because obviously I cannot work at the Skatepark during lockdown. </p>
            <p>I find a little bit of joy from the amazing friends I have made online, but I just wish I could see them face-to-face.</p>
            <p>I miss the world like it once was, but I am still hoping that the world is different for the better after all of this. </p>

            <h2>BLM</h2>
        </header>
        <article>
           <p>So something awful is currently happening in America. An innocent black man was killed by police officers by being essentially strangled on the ground even though he was complying with the officer’s demands. </p>
           <p>This sparked huge outcry and many people took to the streets to protest where they were greeted with more mindless police brutality. People believe that racism and classism is only prevalent in cops in America, but it is honestly a problem everywhere.</p>
           <p>Some people will say “ah I don’t believe protests should be violent” but Pride was started by Black Queer people rioting because they did not have rights. Sometimes violence is needed to change the world and I agree with that if the outcome is for the greater good.</p>
           <p>If you do not support the Black Lives Matter Movement you sure as hell do not get to support me. </p>
