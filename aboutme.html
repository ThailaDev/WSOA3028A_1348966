<h2>Skating and Proffession</h2>

<article>
<p>I have been skating almost every day since I was 15 years old. I have been working at Johannesburg's best skate park for over two years now, situated in Bryanston. My duties at work include managing park memberships, taking daily payments from customers, organising and taking stock of the skate shop and keeping the park neat and tidy.</p>
<p>In the beginning of 2020 Johannesburg set up its own skate club. Being part of a club is imperiitive in the process of being a part of the Olympics.</p>
