        <article>
            <p>Hey guys this is going to be a part two of the Information Technologies blog that I did a little while ago. This one will be more about how the internet is shaped by and shapes geographies. The reading I will be using to support what I talk about in this blog post is How Geography Shapes and Is Shaped by the Internet by Shane Greenstein, Chris Forman, and Avi Goldfarb.</p>
            <p>The introduction of internet influenced different areas in different ways. The internet is mostly beneficial to all areas, but it is more beneficial to certain areas. </p>
            <p>The introduction of the internet influences three factors: The cost of communication, the cost of transportation and the cost of searching (Greenstein, Forman and Goldfarb, 2018). </p>
            <p>Communication costs are very low when sending through messages through message specific cites like emailing, whatsapp and Microsoft Teams. The cost is the same regardless of distance, unlike phonecalls. </p>
            <p>Transportation costs are lower because if products can be sent digitally there will be no distribution costs. Buying products online that cannot be digitalized reduces the need for travel, although shipping costs apply. </p>
            <p>Search costs are influenced by transportation and communication costs, so if those are low, people can easily search and compare knowledge on certain information. </p>
            <p>It is argued that cities become less important when communication costs are low because it lowers the need for face-to-face communication which can be done remotely (Greenstein, Forman and Goldfarb, 2018). This will allow more jobs to be created outside of the city. </p>
            <p>Using the internet has different costs in different areas because of the cost implementing IT services and broadband. Therefore, in places with more infrastructure such as cities, there will be lower costs and people can access the internet a lot easier than in places with less infrastructure.</p>
            <p>It also costs to use the internet because people need expensive devices to do so. Only people who can afford these devices can reap the benefits of the internet and lower costs. </p>
            <p>There is an argument to whether the internet causes a convergence or divergence in income (Greenstein, Forman and Goldfarb, 2018). I believe it causes a divergence and disproportionately benefits people who already are privileged because people need expensive devices to access it. Therefore, these already privileged people become more privileged.</p>
            <p>It is shown that only 6% of countries experienced wage growth with the implementation of the internet and those were already privileged areas (Greenstein, Forman and Goldfarb, 2018). </p>
            <p>In conclusion, the internet allowed for lower costs on communication, travel and search, but only those who can afford to or have the infrastructure to access the internet can reap these benefits.</p>
