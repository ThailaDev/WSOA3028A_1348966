            <h1>26/06/2020 - Racism within Systems</h1>
        
        <article >
           <p>Hey everyone, today I will be looking at a tweet in which a British Passport system failed to recognise a person because it claimed their mouth was open. I will be using this tweet as a case study to explain why technology is not neutral. In fact, technology is a product of society and its power relations.</p>
           <p>Technology and programs are predominantly written by white men, this is since there is a greater access and use of internet in the global North. As previous blogposts have stated women often underestimate their abilities online and therefore are not as prominent in the IT industry. </p>
           <p>The passport system is British and was most likely created by a white guy who did not account for the fact that people of colour may have slightly different features than white people so the system failed to recognise a black person with bigger lips. This is not only annoying but also racist if you ask me.</p>
           <p>If more people of colour, especially women of colour were given the opportunities to work in the IT industries then white people would not have as much control over systems which tend to oppress non white people, in turn making those systems less oppressive. </p>
           <p>Although it may not have been the white maleâ€™s intention to have his system behave in such a racist way, he did not think of people of colour while creating his system, and that is the problem. </p>
           <p>Things like this occurs not only in passport systems but in plenty of other things such as algorithms which recommend things to you based on people you already follow. For example, if one happens to follow one white person on TikTok, many of the POC creators will not be recommended to you unless you actively seek them out.</p>
           <p>Obviously, this is a huge issue that can only be solved by people of colour and women and women of colour entering the IT force. </p>
