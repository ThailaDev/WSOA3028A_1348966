        <article>
            <p>Hey guys!! Once again, this blog post is a continuation of the last blog post I made so if you have not, read that one first. Today I will be talking about digital inequalities again but this time in relation to artificial intelligence.</p>
            <p>We have already learned that some groups do not benefit from the internet as they may not be able to access it as well as others. </p>
            <p>The first level of digital divide describes unequal access to the internet (Lutz, 2019). Some people such as older, uneducated individuals struggle to access the internet. Also, those who live in rural areas struggle to access the internet. Devices such as Alexa or Siri even discriminate because they struggle to understand many dialects and accents however, they have the potential to make the lives of disabled people a lot easier. </p>
            <p>The second level of digital divide speaks on the inequalities of skills and uses (Lutz, 2019). Research on this level focuses on the individuals use of internet outside of work. Those who are more skilled at using applications and online platforms will be more successful in marketing themselves and knowing how to use the internet safely. They will have less of a chance of being scammed over the internet. </p>
            <p>The third level of digital divide refers to the differences in digital gain (Lutz, 2019). This assumes that the rich get richer because of how they use the internet. Some people had money to invest in cryptocurrencies and are now millionaires. Digital gain also refers to if people saved money by using the internet (such as from buying online). Not all can do this since not all have access to the internet.</p>
