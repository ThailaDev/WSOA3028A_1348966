            <h1>20/04/2020 - Information Geographies</h1>
        
        <article >
            <p>Hey guys, today I’m going to be chatting about Information Geographies in quite a bit of detail, so I hope you can keep up!</p>  
            <p>Information must come from somewhere, right? Geographic augmentations not only represent a part of the world, but forms part of the place itself. Information geographies have their own distributions such as access, representation and participation. I will be looking at where geographic information comes from using Graham, De Sabbata and Zook’s ‘Towards a Study of information technologies: (im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of information’ (Graham, De Sabbata and Zook, 2015). </p>  
            <p>‘Immutable mobiles’ refers to information that can be moved without any significant changes occurring to the information. In the printing press era, the information was stored on an immutable physical object such as paper and could be easily transported. The geography of immutable geographies was found in things like books and contained geographically referenced information. </p>
            <p>ICTs have created (Im)mutable augmentations which are immutable depending on how the software works. This kind of software allows for images, locations and names of places to be accessible through online maps and websites. An example of an (im)mutable augmentation would be GPS or google maps. If a place, such as a shopping Centre is not on the (im)mutable augmentation software they could possibly have no one find them and have to close because nobody would really know they exist, unless they happened upon it by chance, so as you can see, this shapes the place rather than just reflecting it. </p>
            <p>The geography of information directly reflects power, as information is used as a form of control. Previously only scholars or highly educated people could contribute to the spread of information, however now due to the ‘information revolution’ which allows anyone with means to do so, to contribute content to the internet. For the first time we have the technologies to allow people from all sorts of socio-economic backgrounds to contribute to the spread and formation of information. </p>
            <p>It is clear, from the research done by Graham, De Sabbata and Zook that there are more internet users in the global north such as North America, China and Europe, than the global south which includes countries such as Africa and South America. Three billion people had access to the internet when this article was written, which means that most of the world is still without access. </p>
            <p>Africa’s broadband can cost as much as 250% off an individual’s income, this is mostly due to low average income and not the price of broadband. In America and Europe Broadband is much more affordable at an average of 10% of an individual’s income. </p>
            <p>Majority of domain names are registered in North America at 78%. Western Europe and North America are the biggest contributors to information when it comes to domains. North America and Europe once again has the largest number of contributors when it comes to code sharing on GitHub. When it comes to contributors on Wikipedia the Global North contributes a lot more than the Global South.  Most of Africa, contributes very little. </p>
            <p>When it comes to representation within (im)mutable geographies on Google Searches, OpenStreetMap, the Semantic Web and Geonames The United States as well as China, Japan and some of Europe are mostly mentioned. </p>
            <p>Although there are some outliers it seems as though the biggest contributors and representation of (im)mutable geographies are from North America, Europe and China. </p>
            <p>These statistics could possibly be due to the North having more access to internet, being able to afford broadband and simply because their citizen’s average income allows them to afford internet as well as devices to access the internet. </p>
            <p>According to pewresearch.org it is more likely for younger people so those with an aging population should by this logic have less internet access. In South Africa only one in six millennials have access to the internet, however. This is most likely due to our low minimum incomes which does not allow poorer people to afford smart devices or afford data or broadband internet. </p>
            <p>It has also been shown that more educated people often have more access to the internet than less educated people. In third world countries many people have limited access to education. These third world countries are often in the global South. </p>
            <p>To conclude this lengthy blogpost age, education and income have a roll in how many people have internet access and who can and cannot contribute to geographical information, it is clear that the global north holds more power than the global south when it comes to the distribution of information. </p>
