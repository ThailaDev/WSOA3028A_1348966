        </section>
        <article>
            <p>Hello Readers! I Hope you all are ready for a knowledge bomb because today I’m going to be writing about hypertext, which I found to be pretty complicated. </p>
            <p>So, the oxford dictionary describes hypertext as being a software system which allows for cross-referencing between related sections of a text and other related material. Ted Nelson came up with the term ‘Hypertext’ for forms of hypermedia. Hypertext allows for link-based hypertext as well as ‘stretch text’.</p>
            <p>An example of hypertext in use would be in web pages such as Wikipedia. It allows the user to easily browse through the large database by allowing users to click on a word on the current page, taking them to a new page with information about the clicked word. For a clearer example: Sally searches ‘Web 2.0’ on Wikipedia, on the page some words are blue which means they can be clicked on. In the first sentence on the Wikipedia page, the word ‘websites’ is blue. Sally clicks on websites and Wikipedia takes sally to a page all about websites this is possible because websites is associated with Web 2.0. </p>
            <p>I know this is quite difficult to understand for some, it was for me, so hopefully I have explained it in a way that makes it simpler to understand. </p>
            <p>So, in conclusion, Hypertext is a software system that links information by association.</p>
