            <p>We, as humans, design constantly. We design our day to day lives, our bedrooms, our gardens and so much more. The planning towards any outcome can be called design. </p>    
            <p>We follow our intuition during the design process because through intuition we execute impressions, ideas and thoughts. Design must have meaning to bring about a response when the thing which is designed is used, seen or heard. </p>
            <p>In design it is said that form and function are one or that form follows function. In other words, form is the aesthetics and function are how well it works. The six parts which make up the function complex are: Method, Use, Telesis, Need, Aesthetics and Association. </p>
            <p>Method encompasses how tools, materials and processes are used. They must be the best possible items for what is being designed, cost wise and use wise. </p>
            <p>Use describes how well the thing functions, for example, a water bottle must contain water and not spill easily. </p>
            <p>Need has often been neglected for desires and wants because human needs are often difficult and less profitable to satisfy. </p>
            <p>Telesis says that design must accommodate the current time’s socioeconomic order. </p>
            <p>The consumer must not associate the product or thing with gimmickry and must take into consideration what the consumer or user wants. Most associational values are similar within a people.</p>
            <p>Aesthetics is a tool which designers use to make the creation meaningful. It is the designer’s personal expression.</p>
            <p>These are all aspects which designers have to take into consideration when designing something. </p>
