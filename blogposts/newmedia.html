            <p>Currently something like researching using a digital device is playful. The screen entices the user and allows them to react in their own way to new information. The Malaysian University argues that reading websites releases the user from the mundane and sometimes gives the user what is called disciplined distraction and productivity in the form of ‘serious fun’. </p>    
            <p>New media and social media allow users to feel less isolated and to feel closer to their loved ones who potentially live far away from them. The internet helps to empowers and liberates ordinary people and encourages them to join communities which are like-minded to them.</p>
            <p>Due to the screen showing users information in real time it captures the audience’s attention, allowing them to be immersed in a malleable space, which is known as the cyberspace. New media engages users in a way the old media could not. Browsers are rewarded with instant news and they can immediately share it with others by sharing links or tagging their friends in posts. </p>
            <p>Because of this fast-paced accessible way of finding news, the old media, such as print newspapers and magazines have started making websites in order to get their news stories out faster as well as to attract the younger generations which are more enticed by the digital. </p>
            <p>To navigate the internet, clicking is used whether it is clicking on a menu, hypertext or just a simple next button. Users click to get from one page to another. Through hypertext and clicking on them the user can be transported to other pages which relates to the previous page. </p>
            <p>The internet has helped so many people around the world to feel less alone, to receive news instantly and with so much more. </p>
