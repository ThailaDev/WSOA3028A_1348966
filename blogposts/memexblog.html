        <article>
            <p>Hey Readers, today’s blog post is about a very interesting invention that was never really made that is pretty like some current technology that we use almost daily. It was invented by a scientist named Vannevar Bush.</p>
            <p>Vannevar Bush was a prolific scientist who dedicated a lot of his time to applicating science to warfare. After the war was over, he urged scientists to continue to develop instruments to make knowledge more accessible. During the war, Bush was the head of the U.S office of scientific research and development. Bush believed that scientific research was very important for security and economic wellbeing. </p>
            <p>Vannevar Bush came up with his own analogue ‘computer’ invention after the war. He called this invention the ‘Memex’. The ‘Memex’ would theoretically give its user access to information which would be stored on ‘microfilm’ because he believed that compressing information for easy storage was very important, however at the time the materials needed for microfilm was much more expensive than printing so making many microfilms would be too expensive to be plausible. The ‘Memex’ would consist of a desk, translucent screens for easy projecting, a board with buttons and levers to access the microfilm and it would allow its user to find the information based on associative indexing. The user would be able to make trails between information so that they can find their research easily. </p>
            <p>The ‘Memex’ was never actually created due to limited resources and the limitations of the time (1939), however, many years later the digital computer came to be and in 1983 the internet was invented and with that came the creation of Wikipedia which basically gives the user the same abilities as the Vannevar Bush wanted the ‘Memex’ to do.</p>
