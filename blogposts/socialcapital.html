            <h1>13/06/2020 - Social Capital</h1>
        
        <article >
            <p>Hey everyone, this blog post is going to be explaining some things about social and digital capital.</p>
            <p>Social Capital is defined as: entities which have two characteristics in common – they consist of some aspects of social structure as well as being a facilitator between the actions of individuals who are within said social structure (Ragnedda and Ruiu, 2017).</p>
            <p>The internet can be used for people with similar interests to come together and meet up to ‘build’ something together (Ragnedda and Ruiu, 2017). Some people believe that these virtual spaces allow for people to reach a common objective, however, others believe that the more someone spends online in these spaces, the less they achieve in ‘real’ life.</p>
            <p>The digital divide may increase inequalities when it comes to social capital. Human ties, trust and the environment increase social capital. Social capital is a collective resource that increases an individual’s and that of the collective’s benefits. </p>
            <p>Social Capital generates inequalities between people who can and cannot access the internet and in terms of motivation, skills and purpose of the use of the internet, as well as inequalities pertaining to the benefits people can gain while using the internet (Ragnedda and Ruiu, 2017). </p>
            <p>One does not access the internet as a blank slate. Our experiences heavily depend on our backgrounds and of our own social, economic, and personal capital (Ragnedda and Ruiu, 2017). All of this influences the way people use the internet, what they search and what they process. </p>
            <p>Cultural and economic capital plays a role in the generation of digital capital which in turn influences social, economic, and cultural capital as well. Traditional social inequalities are reinforced by digital inequalities (Ragnedda and Ruiu, 2017). </p>
