            <p>Hey Guys! This is Ali, I’m taking over from Thaila for today because I discovered something pretty rad. There is such a thing as Web 2.0, not just “the web”. Web 1.0 was known as the ‘Read - Only’ web. Users of web 1.0 could only search for information and read about it. They couldn’t even post their own stuff! Imagine that. </p>
            <p>Now Web 2.0 allows the users to post their own content. These users are usually known as content creators, but these days who isn’t a content creator. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and now Tik-Tok make almost all their users into content creators. If you have ever posted a video or image that you made on the web or some sort of web orientated platform, you are a content creator. Web 2.0 also revolutionized the way that businesses interact with their client base, as they can directly advertise to users who follow their social medias and respond to queries online as opposed to over the phone. </p>
            <p>Web 2.0 isn’t even where it ends! There is a web 3.0, which I find absolutely mind blowing. Web 3.0 now allows services or businesses such as Ali-Express to look at what you have bought and can recommend other products to you based on your purchase history and what others have bought along with your previous purchases. The web uses artificial intelligence to learn things about you as a user and to recommend sites and products based on what it knows about you.</p>
            <p>The web is quite rad. If it is so cool and intelligent now, imagine what it will be like in a few years.</p>
