            <h1>17/05/2020 - My thoughts on Information Geographies and Digital Inequalities</h1>
        
        <article>
           <p>Hey guys, today I will be sharing my views on the series of blog posts I made about digital inequalities and Information Geographies. </p>
           <p>I believe that only the richer North really experiences any advantages from the internet as many of those in the poorer South do not live in areas where they have infrastructure to access the internet. Mostly people who live outside of the cities do not have reliable internet access. </p>
           <p>Thankfully, some companies such as Vumatel are giving back and providing areas like these with the infrastructure as well as cheap internet plans to help uplift themselves. This however does not really help the fact that the people in these areas often do not have access to smart devices which can be used to access the internet.</p>
           <p>In my opinion the wage gap and education gap will just keep getting wider unless governments provide all their citizens with smart devices such as tablets which can be used to access the internet.</p>
           <p>This will uplift so many people by allowing them to teach themselves valuable skills from platforms such as Youtube or Udemy which will enable them to become part of the skilled labour force. </p>
           <p>Internet access to these people will also uplift their areas as more people will have the skills to bring in income to those areas. I do know that these things probably wonâ€™t happen due to government corruption but I do think if this is implemented it will be a win-win situation for the people and the economy. </p>
