            <h1>17/06/2020 - APIs and External Dependancies</h1>
        
        <article>
            <p>Hey guys, I am going to be chatting about Dependencies and API’s although I, myself am not 100% confident in my understanding of this subject but bear with me as we learn together. </p>
            <p>API stands for Application Program Interface. API’s allow for communication between multiple software intermediaries. API’s allow teams to essentially copy code from someone else by using dependencies. An example of this is a team could use an external dependency such as a weather display API to display the weather on their website or application without programming the entirety of that software, and by simply referencing it in code. </p>
            <p>GoogleMaps created an API which allows other websites to embed and customise maps on their site. It is apparently a very small step to make an API accessible for public use (Boakes, 2014). </p>
            <p>The Dependency I chose was The Chuck Norris Joke generator. I chose this because none of the others I tried to use worked mostly because I still have a lot to learn about how to implement them and my JavaScript coding is in dire need of practice. I followed the class given tutorial without copying the tutorial’s exact code to get to my outcome. This dependency is not necessarily important, but it is good that it exists so that people who want to use it do not have to go through the effort to code it themselves.</p>
            <p>External dependencies make web developers lives easier in that case.</p>
            <p>The main issue I had when trying to get the APIs to work were the API Keys. In the tutorial these were not covered however most free APIs require keys to authenticate the user or to control access of the API (Boakes, 2014). API’s such as Google Pay or Adsense allows a web developer to allow customers to pay for their content. </p>
            <p>“The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources” (Fetch basic concepts, 2020). Fetch is promise based which allows for a response. </p>
            <p>I’m honestly hoping to learn more about external dependencies and API’s in my free time but for now this is all I can tell you guys. I hope this made sense!</p>
