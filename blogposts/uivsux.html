            <h1>23/04/2020 - UI vs UX</h1>
        
        <article>
            <p>Hey guys, its Ali here. Thaila is letting me take over today to teach ya’ll about UX/UI as I was confused as to what the differences are between the two and what each entail.</p>  
            <p>Okay so the first thing I found out was that UX is what makes interfaces useful and UI makes the interface nice to look at. Good UI and UX design ensure that web users are more likely to come back to your site. </p> 
            <p>UX stands for User Experience and UI stands for User Interaction. </p> 
            <p>When designing the UX it is important for the designer to think from the user’s point of view. The designer must carefully curate the UX so that they can influence what the user feels when they use the site. </p>
            <p>UX design is usually done before the UI design.</p>
            <p>UI focuses on the user’s visual experience. Colour schemes, buttons, scrollers and layout all fall under UI design. UI designers need to make sure that their design choices are user friendly which means it should not be too complicated. The navigation of the webpage should come naturally to the user when the UI design is good. </p>
            <p>So yeah, that is the basics. I hope you find this information useful! Skate on people!</p>
