            <p>Hello readers, my name is Thaila. I am an interactive media student in the year 2020 at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. Our goal this year is to create a website for a fictional character of our choosing, learn how to use GitHub and to make weekly blog posts about interesting things that we have learned about the web in our lectures and outside of our lectures and to post them on said website.</p>
            <p>The character that I have created is a South African Skater named Ali who is based in Johannesburg. Her objective is to make it into the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. Ali is very passionate about skating as well as topics such as the LGBTQIA+ communities and feminism. </p>
            <p>Skateboarding has been an important part of Aliâ€™s life since she was 15 years old. She is now 24 years old and currently manages one of the best skateparks in Johannesburg. She has won a few small competitions around the country and one larger one in Kimberly in 2018. She hopes to crush her competition in the Olympic qualifiers. </p>
            <p>Ali is very loosely based on myself (I am not a very good skater as at the time of writing this blog post I have only been skating for about 3 months). This journey is going to be an enjoyable one for me, and hopefully for you too as I learn about web development and flesh out Ali, as a character a bit more. </p>
