        <article>
            <p>President Cyril Ramaphosa has introduced the idea of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in South Africa. He has gotten a lot of criticism for it as people are concerned that jobs will be taken away from the people if more jobs become automated. There are also not enough skilled people in South Africa to push this revolution forward (Sutherland, 2019). </p>
            <p>The Fourth Industrial Revolution refers to 3D printing, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Industrial Internet of Things and robotics (Sutherland, 2019). It could also include Virtual Reality Simulations. </p>
            <p>Many people in South Africa do not think that the implementation of this revolution will be possible because South Africa has always been known for agricultural and raw products to the rest of the world so there are more unskilled physical labourers than skilled internet professionals in South Africa. </p>
            <p>Still today the ANC struggles to uplift its people out of poverty, so in my opinion, before focusing on a new industrial revolution South Africa should focus on taking care of its people.</p>
            <p>In my previous blogs I have talked about how many South Africans don’t have access to the internet, so how will they be able to cope with this revolution if they cannot even be part of it? </p>
            <p>4IR is just a term used to “spin an elitist and neoliberal vision of the future of manufacturing in a confusing and disrupted economy” (Sutherland, 2019).</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the fourth industrial revolution will most likely not happen in South Africa any time soon. The government would have to fix a lot of thigs first before that can happen.  </p>
            <p>I would like to say that I am all for implementing 3D printing, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Industrial Internet of Things and robotics into our every day lives however I am not optimistic enough to believe it will happen in South Africa any time soon. </p>
