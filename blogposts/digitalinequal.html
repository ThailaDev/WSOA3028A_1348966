            <h1>09/05/2020 - Digital Inequalities</h1>
        
        <article>
            <p>Hello again! Today I am going to be talking about Digital Inequalities. This sort of ties into my last blog post about Internet and geographies. There is not a lost of research on digital inequalities and the impact of the internet on equality however it is important and there will hopefully be more research about it in the future. I will be using a reading called Digital inequalities and why they matter by Laura Robinson, Shelia R. Cotten, Hiroshi Ono, Anabel Quan-Haase, Gustavo Mesch, Wenhong Chen, Jeremy Schulz, Timothy M. Hale & Michael J. Stern to substantiate my ideas.</p>
            <p>There are many forms of inequalities such as gender, race, sexuality, religion but now there are a few more, digital inequalities are one of the prominent ones. Digital inequalities do however, combine with other offline inequalities. </p>
            <p>It is shown that mostly white, young males use the internet frequently (Robinson et al., 2015).Groups who are already disadvantaged may use the internet a lot less frequently than their advantaged counterparts (Robinson et al., 2015) -ie- Young white men. </p>
            <p>Employees today find it hard to balance work and life on the internet as it overlaps. If one uses the internet for research, they could be tempted to check Facebook and visa versa when at home. This creates a lot of stress for todayâ€™s workforce (Robinson et al., 2015). Those workers who are better at navigating the internet have a strong advantage over those who do not. </p>
            <p>Age wise, older, less educated individuals do not always know how to use the internet and that gives them a disadvantage over the older, more educated individuals who know how to use it. </p>
            <p>It is shown that women underestimate their online skills a lot more than men do. Men do tend to overestimate themselves and women tend to underestimate themselves even though the access to internet between the genders are almost equal (Robinson et al., 2015). Men still heavily outnumber women in the IT industry. </p>
            <p>Racial inequalities are often heightened on the internet due to the economic division between the global north and the global south (Robinson et al., 2015). Only 3% of internet users come from Africa although it accounts for 14% of the entire population. </p>
            <p>In the future, a lot of people may become unemployed because a lot of jobs will be computer automated and only those who are skilled at using a computer or the internet will be employable which will create an even bigger wage gap than there currently is. </p>
            <p>I hope this has educated you a little bit about digital inequalities as it is important to acknowledge our privileges. </p>
