<H2>14/02/2020 - Introduction </H2>
</header>
<article>
<p>Hello readers, my name is Thaila. I am an interactive media student in the year 2020 at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. Our goal this year is to create a website for a fictional character of our choosing, learn how to use GitHub and to make weekly blog posts about interesting things that we have learned about the web in our lectures and outside of our lectures and to post them on said website.</p>
<p>The character that I have created is a South African Skater named Ali who is based in Johannesburg. Her objective is to make it into the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. Ali is very passionate about skating as well as topics such as the LGBTQIA+ communities and feminism. </p>
<p>Skateboarding has been an important part of Ali’s life since she was 15 years old. She is now 24 years old and currently manages one of the best skateparks in Johannesburg. She has won a few small competitions around the country and one larger one in Kimberly in 2018. She hopes to crush her competition in the Olympic qualifiers. </p>
<p>Ali is very loosely based on myself (I am not a very good skater as at the time of writing this blog post I have only been skating for about 3 months). This journey is going to be an enjoyable one for me, and hopefully for you too as I learn about web development and flesh out Ali, as a character a bit more. </p>

<h2>20/02/2020 - The Memex</h2>
</header>
<article>
<p>Hey Readers, today’s blog post is about a very interesting invention that was never really made that is pretty like some current technology that we use almost daily. It was invented by a scientist named Vannevar Bush.</p>
<p>Vannevar Bush was a prolific scientist who dedicated a lot of his time to applicating science to warfare. After the war was over, he urged scientists to continue to develop instruments to make knowledge more accessible. During the war, Bush was the head of the U.S office of scientific research and development. Bush believed that scientific research was very important for security and economic wellbeing. </p>
<p>Vannevar Bush came up with his own analogue ‘computer’ invention after the war. He called this invention the ‘Memex’. The ‘Memex’ would theoretically give its user access to information which would be stored on ‘microfilm’ because he believed that compressing information for easy storage was very important, however at the time the materials needed for microfilm was much more expensive than printing so making many microfilms would be too expensive to be plausible. The ‘Memex’ would consist of a desk, translucent screens for easy projecting, a board with buttons and levers to access the microfilm and it would allow its user to find the information based on associative indexing. The user would be able to make trails between information so that they can find their research easily. </p>
<p>The ‘Memex’ was never actually created due to limited resources and the limitations of the time (1939), however, many years later the digital computer came to be and in 1983 the internet was invented and with that came the creation of Wikipedia which basically gives the user the same abilities as the Vannevar Bush wanted the ‘Memex’ to do.</p>

<h2>29/02/2020 - Web 2.0</h2>
</header>
<article>
<p>Hey Guys! This is Ali, I’m taking over from Thaila for today because I discovered something pretty rad. There is such a thing as Web 2.0, not just “the web”. Web 1.0 was known as the ‘Read - Only’ web. Users of web 1.0 could only search for information and read about it. They couldn’t even post their own stuff! Imagine that. </p>
<p>Now Web 2.0 allows the users to post their own content. These users are usually known as content creators, but these days who isn’t a content creator. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and now Tik-Tok make almost all their users into content creators. If you have ever posted a video or image that you made on the web or some sort of web orientated platform, you are a content creator. Web 2.0 also revolutionized the way that businesses interact with their client base, as they can directly advertise to users who follow their social medias and respond to queries online as opposed to over the phone. </p>
<p>Web 2.0 isn’t even where it ends! There is a web 3.0, which I find absolutely mind blowing. Web 3.0 now allows services or businesses such as Ali-Express to look at what you have bought and can recommend other products to you based on your purchase history and what others have bought along with your previous purchases. The web uses artificial intelligence to learn things about you as a user and to recommend sites and products based on what it knows about you.</p>
<p>The web is quite rad. If it is so cool and intelligent now, imagine what it will be like in a few years.</p>

<h2>03/03/2020 - What is Hypertext?</h2>
</header>
<article>
<p>Hello Readers! I Hope you all are ready for a knowledge bomb because today I’m going to be writing about hypertext, which I found to be pretty complicated. </p>
<p>So, the oxford dictionary describes hypertext as being a software system which allows for cross-referencing between related sections of a text and other related material. Ted Nelson came up with the term ‘Hypertext’ for forms of hypermedia. Hypertext allows for link-based hypertext as well as ‘stretch text’.</p>
<p>An example of hypertext in use would be in web pages such as Wikipedia. It allows the user to easily browse through the large database by allowing users to click on a word on the current page, taking them to a new page with information about the clicked word. For a clearer example: Sally searches ‘Web 2.0’ on Wikipedia, on the page some words are blue which means they can be clicked on. In the first sentence on the Wikipedia page, the word ‘websites’ is blue. Sally clicks on websites and Wikipedia takes sally to a page all about websites this is possible because websites is associated with Web 2.0. </p>
<p>I know this is quite difficult to understand for some, it was for me, so hopefully I have explained it in a way that makes it simpler to understand. </p>
<p>So, in conclusion, Hypertext is a software system that links information by association.</p>

<h2>03/15/2020 - New Media</h2>    
</header>  
<article>
<p>Currently something like researching using a digital device is playful. The screen entices the user and allows them to react in their own way to new information. The Malaysian University argues that reading websites releases the user from the mundane and sometimes gives the user what is called disciplined distraction and productivity in the form of ‘serious fun’. </p>    
<p>New media and social media allow users to feel less isolated and to feel closer to their loved ones who potentially live far away from them. The internet helps to empowers and liberates ordinary people and encourages them to join communities which are like-minded to them.</p>
<p>Due to the screen showing users information in real time it captures the audience’s attention, allowing them to be immersed in a malleable space, which is known as the cyberspace. New media engages users in a way the old media could not. Browsers are rewarded with instant news and they can immediately share it with others by sharing links or tagging their friends in posts. </p>
<p>Because of this fast-paced accessible way of finding news, the old media, such as print newspapers and magazines have started making websites in order to get their news stories out faster as well as to attract the younger generations which are more enticed by the digital. </p>
<p>To navigate the internet, clicking is used whether it is clicking on a menu, hypertext or just a simple next button. Users click to get from one page to another. Through hypertext and clicking on them the user can be transported to other pages which relates to the previous page. </p>
<p>The internet has helped so many people around the world to feel less alone, to receive news instantly and with so much more. </p>

<h2>04/07/2020 - Design</h2>    
</header> 
<article>
<p>We, as humans, design constantly. We design our day to day lives, our bedrooms, our gardens and so much more. The planning towards any outcome can be called design. </p>    
<p>We follow our intuition during the design process because through intuition we execute impressions, ideas and thoughts. Design must have meaning to bring about a response when the thing which is designed is used, seen or heard. </p>
<p>In design it is said that form and function are one or that form follows function. In other words, form is the aesthetics and function are how well it works. The six parts which make up the function complex are: Method, Use, Telesis, Need, Aesthetics and Association. </p>
<p>Method encompasses how tools, materials and processes are used. They must be the best possible items for what is being designed, cost wise and use wise. </p>
<p>Use describes how well the thing functions, for example, a water bottle must contain water and not spill easily. </p>
<p>Need has often been neglected for desires and wants because human needs are often difficult and less profitable to satisfy. </p>
<p>Telesis says that design must accommodate the current time’s socioeconomic order. </p>
<p>The consumer must not associate the product or thing with gimmickry and must take into consideration what the consumer or user wants. Most associational values are similar within a people.</p>
<p>Aesthetics is a tool which designers use to make the creation meaningful. It is the designer’s personal expression.</p>
<p>These are all aspects which designers have to take into consideration when designing something. </p>

<h2>04/20/2020 - Information Geographies</h2>    
</header> 
<article>
<p>Hey guys, today I’m going to be chatting about Information Geographies in quite a bit of detail, so I hope you can keep up!</p>  
<p>Information must come from somewhere, right? Geographic augmentations not only represent a part of the world, but forms part of the place itself. Information geographies have their own distributions such as access, representation and participation. I will be looking at where geographic information comes from using Graham, De Sabbata and Zook’s ‘Towards a Study of information technologies: (im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of information’ (Graham, De Sabbata and Zook, 2015). </p>  
<p>‘Immutable mobiles’ refers to information that can be moved without any significant changes occurring to the information. In the printing press era, the information was stored on an immutable physical object such as paper and could be easily transported. The geography of immutable geographies was found in things like books and contained geographically referenced information. </p>
<p>ICTs have created (Im)mutable augmentations which are immutable depending on how the software works. This kind of software allows for images, locations and names of places to be accessible through online maps and websites. An example of an (im)mutable augmentation would be GPS or google maps. If a place, such as a shopping Centre is not on the (im)mutable augmentation software they could possibly have no one find them and have to close because nobody would really know they exist, unless they happened upon it by chance, so as you can see, this shapes the place rather than just reflecting it. </p>
<p>The geography of information directly reflects power, as information is used as a form of control. Previously only scholars or highly educated people could contribute to the spread of information, however now due to the ‘information revolution’ which allows anyone with means to do so, to contribute content to the internet. For the first time we have the technologies to allow people from all sorts of socio-economic backgrounds to contribute to the spread and formation of information. </p>
<p>It is clear, from the research done by Graham, De Sabbata and Zook that there are more internet users in the global north such as North America, China and Europe, than the global south which includes countries such as Africa and South America. Three billion people had access to the internet when this article was written, which means that most of the world is still without access. </p>
<p>Africa’s broadband can cost as much as 250% off an individual’s income, this is mostly due to low average income and not the price of broadband. In America and Europe Broadband is much more affordable at an average of 10% of an individual’s income. </p>
<p>Majority of domain names are registered in North America at 78%. Western Europe and North America are the biggest contributors to information when it comes to domains. North America and Europe once again has the largest number of contributors when it comes to code sharing on GitHub. When it comes to contributors on Wikipedia the Global North contributes a lot more than the Global South.  Most of Africa, contributes very little. </p>
<p>When it comes to representation within (im)mutable geographies on Google Searches, OpenStreetMap, the Semantic Web and Geonames The United States as well as China, Japan and some of Europe are mostly mentioned. </p>
<p>Although there are some outliers it seems as though the biggest contributors and representation of (im)mutable geographies are from North America, Europe and China. </p>
<p>These statistics could possibly be due to the North having more access to internet, being able to afford broadband and simply because their citizen’s average income allows them to afford internet as well as devices to access the internet. </p>
<p>According to pewresearch.org it is more likely for younger people so those with an aging population should by this logic have less internet access. In South Africa only one in six millennials have access to the internet, however. This is most likely due to our low minimum incomes which does not allow poorer people to afford smart devices or afford data or broadband internet. </p>
<p>It has also been shown that more educated people often have more access to the internet than less educated people. In third world countries many people have limited access to education. These third world countries are often in the global South. </p>
<p>To conclude this lengthy blogpost age, education and income have a roll in how many people have internet access and who can and cannot contribute to geographical information, it is clear that the global north holds more power than the global south when it comes to the distribution of information. </p>
