<H2>Blog 1 - Introduction </H2>
<p>Hello readers, my name is Thaila. I am an interactive media student in the year 2020 at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. Our goal this year is to create a website for a fictional character of our choosing, learn how to use GitHub and to make weekly blog posts about interesting things that we have learned about the web in our lectures and outside of our lectures and to post them on said website.</p>
<p>The character that I have created is a South African Skater named Ali who is based in Johannesburg. Her objective is to make it into the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. Ali is very passionate about skating as well as topics such as the LGBTQIA+ communities and feminism. </p>
<p>Skateboarding has been an important part of Ali’s life since she was 15 years old. She is now 24 years old and currently manages one of the best skateparks in Johannesburg. She has won a few small competitions around the country and one larger one in Kimberly in 2018. She hopes to crush her competition in the Olympic qualifiers. </p>
<p>Ali is very loosely based on myself (I am not a very good skater as at the time of writing this blog post I have only been skating for about 3 months). This journey is going to be an enjoyable one for me, and hopefully for you too as I learn about web development and flesh out Ali, as a character a bit more. </p>


<h2>Blog 2 - The Memex</h2>
<p>Hey Readers, today’s blog post is about a very interesting invention that was never really made that is pretty like some current technology that we use almost daily. It was invented by a scientist named Vannevar Bush.</p>
<p>Vannevar Bush was a prolific scientist who dedicated a lot of his time to applicating science to warfare. After the war was over, he urged scientists to continue to develop instruments to make knowledge more accessible. During the war, Bush was the head of the U.S office of scientific research and development. Bush believed that scientific research was very important for security and economic wellbeing. </p>
<p>Vannevar Bush came up with his own analogue ‘computer’ invention after the war. He called this invention the ‘Memex’. The ‘Memex’ would theoretically give its user access to information which would be stored on ‘microfilm’ because he believed that compressing information for easy storage was very important, however at the time the materials needed for microfilm was much more expensive than printing so making many microfilms would be too expensive to be plausible. The ‘Memex’ would consist of a desk, translucent screens for easy projecting, a board with buttons and levers to access the microfilm and it would allow its user to find the information based on associative indexing. The user would be able to make trails between information so that they can find their research easily. </p>
<p>The ‘Memex’ was never actually created due to limited resources and the limitations of the time (1939), however, many years later the digital computer came to be and in 1983 the internet was invented and with that came the creation of Wikipedia which basically gives the user the same abilities as the Vannevar Bush wanted the ‘Memex’ to do.</p>


<h2>Blog 3 - Web 2.0</h2>
<p>Hey Guys! This is Ali, I’m taking over from Thaila for today because I discovered something pretty rad. There is such a thing as Web 2.0, not just “the web”. Web 1.0 was known as the ‘Read - Only’ web. Users of web 1.0 could only search for information and read about it. They couldn’t even post their own stuff! Imagine that. </p>
<p>Now Web 2.0 allows the users to post their own content. These users are usually known as content creators, but these days who isn’t a content creator. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and now Tik-Tok make almost all their users into content creators. If you have ever posted a video or image that you made on the web or some sort of web orientated platform, you are a content creator. Web 2.0 also revolutionized the way that businesses interact with their client base, as they can directly advertise to users who follow their social medias and respond to queries online as opposed to over the phone. </p>
<p>Web 2.0 isn’t even where it ends! There is a web 3.0, which I find absolutely mind blowing. Web 3.0 now allows services or businesses such as Ali-Express to look at what you have bought and can recommend other products to you based on your purchase history and what others have bought along with your previous purchases. The web uses artificial intelligence to learn things about you as a user and to recommend sites and products based on what it knows about you.</p>
<p>The web is quite rad. If it is so cool and intelligent now, imagine what it will be like in a few years.</p>

<h2>Blog 4 - What is Hypertext?</h2>
<p>Hello Readers! I Hope you all are ready for a knowledge bomb because today I’m going to be writing about hypertext, which I found to be pretty complicated. </p>
<p>So, the oxford dictionary describes hypertext as being a software system which allows for cross-referencing between related sections of a text and other related material. Ted Nelson came up with the term ‘Hypertext’ for forms of hypermedia. Hypertext allows for link-based hypertext as well as ‘stretch text’.</p>
<p>An example of hypertext in use would be in web pages such as Wikipedia. It allows the user to easily browse through the large database by allowing users to click on a word on the current page, taking them to a new page with information about the clicked word. For a clearer example: Sally searches ‘Web 2.0’ on Wikipedia, on the page some words are blue which means they can be clicked on. In the first sentence on the Wikipedia page, the word ‘websites’ is blue. Sally clicks on websites and Wikipedia takes sally to a page all about websites this is possible because websites is associated with Web 2.0. </p>
<p>I know this is quite difficult to understand for some, it was for me, so hopefully I have explained it in a way that makes it simpler to understand. </p>
<p>So, in conclusion, Hypertext is a software system that links information by association.</p>
