             <h2>Web Design Rationale</h2>
         </header>
         <article>
            <p>I want the website to show Ali as a skateboarder and as a South African Queer woman.</p>  
            <p> To achieve this I will be posting in Ali's Thoughts about how she, as a character, feels about being a woman in skateboarding.</p>  
            <p> I do not want the colour schemes to be traditionally girly but also not too masculine so I have decided on a nutral colour pallet. </p>
            <p>I want the website to be easy to navigate and minimalist as to not overwhelm viewers. </p>

            <h2>Web Design Rationale 2.0</h2>
        </header>
        <article>
          <p>I would still love to go with the ideas in my previous wireframe however with lockdown and 2020 just being the worst overall I will probably have to find ways to simplify it.</p>
          <p>I have been struggling with motivation issues and mental health during this time so yes, simplifying my designs will be better for me but I hope to stick to as much of the design as humanly possible.</p>

        <article>
         <p>I have gone with the colour scheme that I have originally chose, but due to lockdown and a drop in motivation I was not able to implement the Javascript functions that I wanted to.</p>
         <p>I Actually struggled a lot with Javascript and am hoping to learn a bit more about it soon so that I do not face this same issue next semester.</p>
         <p>Overall my website does achieve the minimalistic affect that I wanted to achieve without some of the functions.</p>
         <p>I am happy with my navigation bar and think it looks pretty sleek. I like that it scales and changes with screen size.</p>
         <p>For this iteration I added a lot of CSS and my website looks more interesting now but I do hope to also improve my CSS skills before next semester.</p>

             <h2>Ali's Character</h2>
         </header>
         <article>
            <p>Ali is a young female South African Skateboarder who stands up for women and LGBTQIA+ rights because she is both a female and part of the LGBTQIA+ community.</p>  
            <p>I made her a skateboarder because I am interested in skateboarding and it is easier to write about things when you, yourself are interested in them.</p>
            <p>Ali is loosely based on myself as I do skate casually and I am also a woman who is part of the LGBTQIA+ community.</p>
            <p>I, Thaila Delport, am very passionate about woman and LGBTQIA+ rights so I thouht it would be appropriate to make ALi like that as well.</p>
